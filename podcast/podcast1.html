  choices you made throughout your life or regret in the poor choices that led 
  you to a lesser quality of life than you were capable of living the little choices 
  you make every day add up in every area of your life every time without 
  exception they can add up positively or negatively the choices you make 
  consistently can add up to a life you love or a life that is suffering the 
  consequences of bad decisions when you add up all of your choices over 
  weeks months years a lifetime the difference in the quality of life you live can 
  be very different depending on the choices you have made it's never one big 
  moment that defines your success or happiness in life it's the little things it's 
  everything every little thing it's every choice you make every day the choice to 
  sleep in or the choice to get up early and work out compound those choices 
  over many years and you have two very different lives both in fitness mentality 
  and quality of life the choice to be grateful for all you do have and practice that 
  every day or to be resentful and bitter always complaining about what is 
  missing what is not there compound those feelings over years and you have 
  two very different lives the amazing things that come to someone who is in 
  genuine appreciation for everything that is good in their life and the negative 
  circumstances that arise from the person who is constantly complaining about 
  what is not there every choice matters if you do or you don't say hi to that 
  person that one little moment could have changed your entire life if you do or 
  don't pick up your phone while driving that one choice can change everything 
  if you do or don't read that book if you do or don't eat those things that you know you shouldn't or those you know you should if you do or don't stand for 
  something you believe in if you do or don't stand up for yourself if you do or 
  don't compare yourself and compete with others if you do or don't show daily 
  gratitude do daily exercise do daily meditation consistently eat healthy every 
  choice every day every moment matters and it is never too late if you have 
  only just realized that the choices you have made over a long period have led 
  you to a place you don't want to be start now paving a new path a path made 
  with stronger choices that lead to a better destination every choice from this 
  moment forward is shaping your future you are the master the captain the 
  director of your life you write the book and the next chapter starts right now 
  you decide where these coming chapters are going based on the path you are 
  paving right now today tomorrow and in the future with every choice you make 
  who you will become in 1 5 10 years will be very different depending on the 
  choices you make in every moment who you will become will depend on the 
  choices you make with consistency when you get to the end of your life when 
  you have pride in the consistent choices you made throughout your life or will 
  you live with regret because of the poor choices that led to a lesser quality of 
  life than you were capable of living the choice is yours in every moment in 
  every day make those choices consciously in presence in confidence and 
  without caring what anyone else expects from you this is your journey and 
  when you make choices that you know are best for you from a place of 
  intuitive knowing from your heart you can bet those choices will lead to better 
  outcomes for you and for others as well you</p>
