                <p>For many years i watched a lot of
                  television because it was tension relieving 
                  i knew it wasn't goal achieving tension 
                  relieving or goal achieving how are your 
                  evenings what are your weekends how do 
                  you spend your free time what do you 
                  control in your life you certainly control 
                  your spiritual beliefs so believe strongly 
                  the way you want you control your 
                  thoughts and attitudes which come out of 
                  your beliefs you certainly control your 
                  goals they're yours your commitments to 
                  your goals no one controls those but you 
                  and your priorities you control your role 
                  models well you don't always control 
                  them and your kids are really attracted 
                  and fascinated by the britney spears 
                  syndrome they're attracted by celebrities 
                  they're attracted by action and violence 
                  why it's just visceral it's like a roller 
                  coaster ride where you put your arms up
                  it frightens you but you want to do it 
                  again and so there's this role modeling 
                  going on unfortunately many of their 
                  personal lives don't match their money 
                  accomplishments your knowledge
                  sources you control those you control 
                  your memberships who you join you 
                  control whether you listen or talk and the 
                  most important thing i've learned is that 
                  third one your free time which i call prime 
                  time why is it prime time because from 7 
                  to 11 pm eastern standard time five 
                  nights a week i'm tired of watching other 
                  people making money having fun in their 
                  professions they want us to watch so they 
                  can get ratings and earn more money we 
                  watch them because we're unhooking
                  from the monotony of our lives and we're
                  hoping to somehow escape from the 
                  drudgery of regular life to live through 
                  the celebrities in reality television it 
                  actually entertains us but if you will
                  understand i've written 15 books and 
                  every one has been written in prime time 
                  7 to 11 pm eastern standard time and on 
                  saturdays you see i can't write during the 
                  week i'm earning money i'm putting food 
                  on the table i have to be doing in prime 
                  time what the rest of the population is 
                  not willing to do the differentiation 
                  between success and mediocrity is what 
                  you do in prime time whether you read 
                  whether you write whether you 
                  computer network and whether you have 
                  intimacy the other thing you can do in 
                  prime time which is fantastic is get off the 
                  couch and out get out of the house and 
                  into ethnic restaurants get to job fairs 
                  computer shows anything that will let you 
                  and your family realize the options that 
                  you have in a world so full of abundance 
                  that it's like a gingerbread world if you'll 
                  just take your children out of the 
                  television internet world and out to 
                  where it's happening and live it rather 
                  than watch it you control your friendships
                  educational level and you do control your 
                  discretionary income which we call
                  disposable income in the united states we 
                  call it disposable because we get any
                  extra we dispose of it as quickly as we can
                  that way we buy things that make us feel
                  good and we go places and put it on our
                  mastercard buy now pay never response 
                  to daily events you control your response 
                  and that's why it's so important to 
                  understand that bad news sells the fire 
                  that burns another warms the general 
                  population the fact they're glad they 
                  weren't the victim of the day so people 
                  pass on bad news it insulates them and 
                  isolates them from the tragedies that are 
                  happening to other people please 
                  understand good news never sells
                  because it's elevator music good news is 
                  no news at all so the only thing you'll 
                  witness is everything that's happening it's 
                  bad and it'll give you just a little bit of a 
                  feeling of jaded concern unless you 
                  understand that it's been going on since 
                  the beginning of time make this note my 
                  definition of spring opportunity spring is 
                  not a guarantee that you're going to have 
                  a harvest but it's the opportunity to plant 
                  one it's not a guarantee that things are 
                  going to go well and you will accumulate 
                  what you need but it is an opportunity to 
                  do so springtime is opportunity now it's 
                  usually a very short season especially 
                  where i was raised in farm country idaho 
                  so here's what you must do with 
                  opportunity seize it quickly don't let it just 
                  come and go when the window of 
                  opportunity is open to borrow a little 
                  space language when they get ready to 
                  shoot the rockets or off into outer space 
                  there's a window they call it of 
                  opportunity to go not go when the 
                  weather's right whatever but if if you wait 
                  a little too long the window closes and it 
                  takes a while for it to open back up so this 
                  is the key take advantage of the spring 
                  such a short season in some places they 
                  got those big tractors with the lights on 
                  them going around the clock in the short 
                  season of spring to make sure that these 
                  seeds are planted take advantage of 
                  opportunity take advantage of 
                  opportunity to meet someone who could 
                  be a colleague for your future career take 
                  advantage of the day when it arrives
                  because the day will soon finish take
                  advantage of the year because it will soon
                  close take advantage my experience is 
                  with people that were probably running 
                  at about 51 percent of our capacity 
                  something i mean you can think about 
                  this yourselves i often ask 
                  undergraduates how many hours a day 
                  you waste or how many hours a week you 
                  waste and the classic answer is something 
                  like four to six hours a day you know 
                  inefficient studying uh watching things on 
                  youtube that not only do you not want to 
                  watch that you don't even care about 
                  that make you feel horrible about 
                  watching after you're done that's 
                  probably four hours right there you know 
                  you think well that's 20 25 hours a week 
                  it's 100 hours a month that's two and a 
                  half full work weeks it's half a year of 
                  work weeks per year and if your time is 
                  worth 20 an hour which is a radical 
                  underestimate it's probably more like 50
                  if you think about it in terms of deferred 
                  wages if you're wasting 20 hours a week 
                  you're wasting 50 000 a year and you are 
                  doing that right now and it's because 
                  you're young wasting 50 000 a year is a 
                  way bigger catastrophe than it would be 
                  for me to waste it because i'm not going 
                  to last nearly as long and so if your life 
                  isn't everything it could be you could ask 
                  yourself well what would happen if you 
                  just stopped wasting the opportunities 
                  that are in front of you you'd be who 
                  knows how much more efficient 10 times 
                  more efficient 20 times more efficient 
                  that's the pareto distribution you have no 
                  idea how efficient efficient people get it's 
                  completely it's off the charts well and if 
                  we all got our act together collectively 
                  and stop making things worse because 
                  that's another thing people do all the 
                  time not only do they not do what they 
                  should to make things better they actively 
                  attempt to make things worse because 
                  they're spiteful or resentful or arrogant or 
                  deceitful or or homicidal or genocidal or 
                  all of those things all bundled together in 
                  an absolutely pathological package if 
                  people stopped really really trying just to 
                  make things worse we have no idea how 
                  much better they would get just because 
                  of that so there's this weird dynamic 
                  that's part of the existential system of 
                  ideas between human vulnerability social 
                  judgment both of which are are our major 
                  causes of suffering and the failure of 
                  individuals to adopt the responsibility
                  that they know they should adopt and 
                  that's the thing that's interesting too is 
                  that and like one of the another thing i've 
                  always often asked my undergraduate 
                  classes is you know there's this idea that
                  that people have that people have a 
                  conscience and you know what the 
                  conscience is it's it's this feeling or voice 
                  you have in your head just before you do 
                  something that you know is stupid telling 
                  you that probably you shouldn't do that 
                  stupid thing you don't have to listen to it 
                  strangely enough but you go ahead and 
                  do it anyways and then of course exactly 
                  what the conscience told you was going 
                  to happen inevitably happen so that you 
                  feel even stupider about it than you 
                  would if it happened by accident because 
                  you you know i knew this was going to 
                  happen i got a warning it was going to 
                  happen and i went and did it anyways
                  and the funny thing too is that that 
                  conscience operates within people and 
                  we really don't understand what the hell 
                  that is so you might say well what would
                  happen if you abided by your conscience 
                  for five years or for ten years what sort of 
                  position might you be in what sort of 
                  family might you have what sort of 
                  relationship might you be able to forge 
                  and you can be bloody sure that a 
                  relationship that's forged on the basis of 
                  who you actually are is going to be a lot 
                  stronger and more welcome than one 
                  that's forged on the basis of who you 
                  aren't now of course that means that the 
                  person you're with has to deal with the 
                  full force of you in all your ability and 
                  your catastrophe and that's a very very 
                  difficult thing to negotiate but if you do 
                  negotiate it well at least you you have 
                  something you have somewhere solid to 
                  stand and you have somewhere to live 
                  you have a real life and it's a great basis 
                  upon which to bring children into the 
                  world for example because you can have 
                  an actual relationship with them instead 
                  of torturing them half to death which is 
                  what happens in a tremendous a 
                  tremendously large minority of cases well 
                  it's more than that too because and this is 
                  what i'll close with and this is why i 
                  wanted to introduce social instance 
                  readings to you you see because it isn't 
                  merely that your fate depends on 
                  whether or not you get your act together 
                  and to what degree you decide that 
                  you're going to live out your own genuine 
                  being it isn't only your fate it's the fate of 
                  everyone that you're networked with and 
                  so you know you think well there's nine 
                  billion seven billion people in the world 
                  we're going to peak at about nine billion 
                  by the way and then it'll decline rapidly 
                  but seven billion people in the world and 
                  who are you you're just one little dust 
                  mote among that seven billion and so it 
                  really doesn't matter what you do or 
                  don't do but that's simply not the case it's 
                  the wrong model because you're at the 
                  center of a network you're a node in a 
                  network of course that's even more true 
                  now that we have social media you'll
                  you'll know a thousand people at least 
                  over the course of your life and they'll 
                  know a thousand people each and that 
                  puts you one person away from a million
                  and two persons away from a billion and
                  so that's how you're connected and the 
                  things you do they're like dropping a 
                  stone in a pond the ripples move outward 
                  and they affect things in ways that you
                  can't fully comprehend and it means that
                  the things that you do and that you don't 
                  do are far more important than you think 
                  and so if you act that way of course the 
                  terror of realizing that is that it actually
                  starts to matter what you do and you 
                  might say well that's better than living a 
                  meaningless existence it's better for it to 
                  matter but i mean if you really asked 
                  yourself would you be so sure if you had 
                  the choice i can live with no responsibility
                  whatsoever the price i pay is that nothing 
                  matters or i can reverse it and everything 
                  matters but i have to take the 
                  responsibility that's associated with that
                  it's not so obvious to me that people 
                  would take the meaningful path you 
                  know when you say well nihilists suffer 
                  dreadfully because there's no meaning in 
                  their life and they still suffer yeah but the 
                  advantage is they have no responsibility
                  so that's the payoff and i actually think 
                  that's the motivation say well i can't help 
                  being nihilistic all my belief systems have 
                  collapsed it's like yeah maybe maybe 
                  you've just allowed them to collapse 
                  because it's a hell of a lot easier than 
                  acting them out and the price you pay is 
                  some meaningless suffering but you can 
                  always whine about that and people will 
                  feel sorry for you and you have the option 
                  of taking the pathway of the martyr so 
                  that's a pretty good deal all things 
                  considered especially when they are 
                  when the alternative is to bear your 
                  burden properly and to live forthrightly in 
                  the world well what solzhenitsyn figured 
                  out and so many people in the 20th 
                  century it's not just him even though he's 
                  the best example is that if you live a 
                  pathological life you pathologize your 
                  society and if enough people do that then 
                  it's hell really really and you can read the 
                  gulag archipelago if you have the 
                  fortitude to do that and you'll see exactly 
                  what hell is like and then you can decide 
                  if that's a place you'd like to visit or even 
                  more importantly if it's a light if it's a 
                  place you'd like to visit and take all your 
                  family and friends because that's what 
                  happened in the 20th century
